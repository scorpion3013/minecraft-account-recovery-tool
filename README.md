# minecraft-account-recovery-tool

IF YOU ARE A CHECKING NOOB USE SIMPLECHECK https://github.com/scorpion3013/SimpleCheck
## Notice:

I got asked a lot if I'm still developing mart, basically I dont know. My main project is checkolotl now which is a general account checker (I will later make an addon for it so rankchecker etc will work.)

If any critical bugs appear in mart, I will fix them. But dont expect regular updates in mart.

Codename: mart

NOTICE: After the current issues are added/fixed this project will be closed and made to a multi-account-recovery-tool (which means support for more websites will be added)

This is a tool to recover your minecraft account made in python 3.6

Only checking for valid accounts -> mart wins in speed and accuracy.

Notice: Having alot of extra checks enabled will slow mart down. (Cause the extra checks arent async yet)
